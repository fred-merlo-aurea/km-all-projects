                        <br />
                        2.1 This is an Agreement for Services, and you are not granted a license to any
                        software by this Agreement. You will not, directly or indirectly: reverse engineer,
                        decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code, object
                        code, or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of, or found at or through the
                        Services or any software, documentation, or data related to the Services (&quot;Software&quot;);
                        remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Services or any Software, modify,
                        translate, or create derivative works based on the Services or any Software; or
                        copy, distribute, pledge, assign, or otherwise transfer or encumber rights to the
                        Services or any Software. The Services shall be used for your internal business
                        (which includes civic or charitable) purposes only and you shall not use the Services
                        or any Software for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise for the
                        benefit of a third party. If you are using the Services in any country in the European
                        Community, the prohibition against modifying, translating, reverse engineering,
                        decompiling, disassembling or creating derivative works based on the Services or
                        the Software does not affect your rights under any legislation implementing the
                        E.C. Council Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs.
                        <br />
                        2.2 You acknowledge and agree that the Services and the TeckMan company names and

                        You are not authorized to use any of the Marks in any advertising, publicity or
                        any other commercial manner without the prior written consent of TeckMan. Your use
                        of the Services confers no title or ownership in the Service, the Software or the
                        Marks and is not a sale of any rights in the Service, the Software or the Marks.
                        All ownership rights remain in TeckMan or its third party suppliers, as the case
                        may be.

                        compliance with the Agreement and all applicable laws (including but not limited
                        to policies and laws related to spamming, privacy, obscenity, or defamation). You
                        agree you will not access or otherwise use third party mailing lists in connection
                        with preparing or distributing unsolicited email to any third party. You hereby
                        agree to indemnify and hold harmless TeckMan against any damages, losses, liabilities,
                        settlements, and expenses (including without limitation costs and reasonable attorneys'
                        fees) in connection with any claim or action that arises from an alleged violation
                        of the foregoing or otherwise arising from or relating to your use of the Services.
                        Although TeckMan has no obligation to monitor the content provided by you or your
                        use of the Services, TeckMan may do so and may remove any such content or prohibit
                        any use of the Services it believes may be (or is alleged to be) in violation of
                        the foregoing.
                        <br />
                        2.4 Every email message sent in connection with the Services may contain an &quot;unsubscribe&quot;
                        link that allows visitors to remove themselves from your mailing list and a link
                        to the then current <a href="/policies/emailPrivacy.cfm">Email Privacy Policy</a>
                        (see Section 2.9 below). You acknowledge and agree that you will not remove, disable
                        or attempt to remove or disable either link. TeckMan may immediately disable your
                        access to the Services if you violate this restriction.
                        <br />
                        2.5 The Services may only be used for lawful purposes. Transmission or solicitation
                        of any material that violates United States federal, state or other laws that may
                        apply in this jurisdiction or your local area is prohibited. This may include material
                        that is obscene, threatening, harassing, libelous, or in any way a violation of
                        intellectual property laws or a third party's intellectual property rights. See
                        TeckMan's <a href="/policies/prohibitedContent.cfm">Prohibited Content and Commerce

                        2.6 For every email message sent in connection with the Services, you acknowledge
                        and agree that the Services may automatically add an identifying footer stating
                        &quot;Powered by ECN.communicator&quot; or a similar message. You agree to cooperate
                        with and provide reasonable assistance to TeckMan in promoting and advertising the
                        Services.
                        <br />
                        2.7 In using the varied features of the Services, you may provide information (such
                        as name, contact information, or other registration information) to TeckMan. TeckMan
                        may use this information and any technical information about your use of the Services
                        to tailor its presentations to you, facilitate your movement through the Service,
                        or communicate separately with you. If you licensed the Services as a result of
                        solicitation by a Marketing Partner of TeckMan, TeckMan may share your information
                        with the Marketing Partner. TeckMan will not provide information to companies you
                        have not authorized, and TeckMan will not permit the companies that get such information
                        to sell and redistribute it without your prior consent.
                        <br />
                        2.8 TeckMan will not use your customer list or any other customer information for
                        any other purposes than those intended with the service. Your customer information
                        will not be shared with any other parties. In addition, TeckMan will not use your
                        customer information for the purpose of sending unsolicited commercial e-mail.
                        <br />
                        2.9 You will adopt and maintain the <a href="/policies/emailPrivacy.cfm">Email Privacy

                        <a href="mailto:support@teckman.com">support@teckman.com</a> or by sending written
                        notice to TeckMan at 800 North Washington Avenue, Suite 459, Minneapolis, MN 55401,
                        USA.

                        3.2 TeckMan may terminate this Agreement or the Services at any time with or without
                        cause, and with or without notice. Upon termination, TeckMan will provide you a
                        proportionate refund of the advance payment that TeckMan has received for the then-current
                        month, based on the number of days remaining in the month following the date of
                        termination. Except for such refund, TeckMan shall have no liability to you or any
                        third party because of such termination.
                        <br />

                        of termination. All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should survive
                        termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership,
                        warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability.
                        <br />
                        3.4 If you do not log into your account for more than 90 days, the account will
                        become inactive. When an account is classified (at TeckMan's sole discretion) as
                        inactive, TeckMan will notify you by email. INACTIVE ACCOUNTS HAVE 30 DAYS TO BECOME
                        ACTIVE OR THE ACCOUNT AND ITS DATA, INCLUDING SUBSCRIBER SIGNUPS, MAY BE PERMANENTLY
                        REMOVED FROM THE TECKMAN DATABASE.

                        occasionally experience &quot;hard outages&quot; due to internet disruptions that
                        are not within TeckMan's control. ANY SUCH HARD OUTAGE SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED A
                        BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY TeckMan. AT TECKMAN'S DISCRETION, A SUBSCRIPTION EXTENSION
                        MAY BE GRANTED IF &quot;HARD OUTAGES&quot; HAVE IMPAIRED THE CUSTOMER'S ABILITY
                        TO USE TeckMan SERVICES.
                        <br />

                        IT MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICES.
                        THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND TECKMAN DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,

                        shall be for TeckMan to use commercially reasonable efforts to adjust or repair

                        Agreement does not violate any agreement or obligation between Customer and any
                        third party.<br />
                        5.2 All materials, including without limitation the Confidential Information, delivered
                        by Customer to TeckMan in support of this Agreement, and Customer's performance
                        of this Agreement, will not infringe on any copyright, patent, trade secret or other
                        proprietary right held by any third party.<br />
                        5.3 None of the activities for which Customer has engaged the Services of TeckMan

                        Customer or its products).<br />

                        business days, of notification from any person that he, she or it desires not to

                        obligation of Customer, enforceable in accordance with its terms.<br />

                        THEORY, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL TECKMAN OR ANY OF ITS UNDERLYING SERVICE
                        PROVIDERS, BUSINESS PARTNERS, INFORMATION PROVIDERS, ACCOUNT PROVIDERS, LICENSORS,

                        provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that

                        or existing at law or equity shall be considered a waiver of such right or remedy.

                        8.3 No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result
                        of the Agreement, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind TeckMan
