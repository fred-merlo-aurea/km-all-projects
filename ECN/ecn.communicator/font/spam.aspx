                    TeckMan has a no tolerance spam policy. TeckMan's customer support actively monitors
                    large import lists and emails going to a large number of subscribers. Any customer
                    found to be using eBlaster for spam will be immediately cut-off from use of the
                    product. If you know of or suspect any violators, please notify us immediately at
                    <a href="mailto:abuse@teckman.com">abuse@teckman.com</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every email contains a mandatory unsubscribe link - those individuals who try to
                    remove this link will be warned that they are doing so. If the link is removed or
                    de-activated in any way, TeckMan will terminate the customer's account.

                    <strong>How TeckMan Protects You From Sending spam </strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eblaster is a permission-based email-marketing tool that follows the strictest permission-based
                    philosophies:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Communication </strong>- Your ECN.communicator registration page already
                        states why you are collecting the site visitor's email address, how you plan to
                        use their address, and that you are following the embedded privacy policy. Additionally,
                        by accepting our license agreement you have agreed to not sell or rent your lists.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Verification </strong>- ECN.communicator automatically sends all of your
                        new subscribers an email confirming their interest in receiving emails from you.
                        Additionally, if your subscriber changes his or her interests or unsubscribes, ECN.communicator
                        automatically sends an email confirmation. </li>
                    <li><strong>Unsubscription</strong> - Every email generated from ECN.communicator contains
                        an unsubscribe link which automatically updates your subscriber lists to avoid the
                        chance of sending unwanted emails to visitors who have unsubscribed. </li>
                    <li><strong>Contact Information</strong> - all of your emails are pre-filled with your
                        contact information </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Isn't There Law Restricting Spam? </strong>
                    <br />
                    Yes, but state spam statutes vary so it is important to conform to the strictest
                    standards. Many states have spam statutes, and they all differ; each state has its
                    own definition of unsolicited commercial email. Additionally, there are various
                    federal agencies keeping track of spam including the Federal Trade Commission.

                    How to protect yourself from Spam: Take the Spam Test
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Are you importing a purchased list of ANY kind? </li>
                    <li>Are you sending to non-specific addresses such as:
                        <br />
                        o sales@domain.com, business@domain.com, webmaster@domain.com, info@domain.com,
                        or other general addresses. </li>
                    <li>Are you sending to distribution lists or mailing lists that send indirectly to a
                        variety of email addresses? </li>
                    <li>Are you mailing to anyone who has not explicitly agreed to join your mailing list?
                    </li>
                    <li>Have you falsified your originating address or transmission path information?
                    </li>
                    <li>Have you used a third party email address or domain name without their permission?
                    </li>
                    <li>Does your email's subject line contain false or misleading information? </li>
                    <li>Does your email fail to provide a working link to unsubscribe?
                        <br />
                        If you have answered YES to ANY of the above questions you will likely be labeled
                        a SPAMMER. For more information visit The Coalition Against Unsolicited Email (www.cauce.org)
