                Our goal is to provide just the right level of service to our clients while simultaneously
                teaching them to be e-mail experts. Our offerings are designed to allow clients
                to mix and match and move seamlessly between whichever levels of software and service
                fit their needs. Ultimately, we encourage many of our clients to bring some or all
                of their e-mail marketing in-house to maximize their security, control and cost
                savings.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our clients have four service options:
                <ol>
                    <li>Self Service ("do-it-yourself") on our ASP platform</li>
                    <li>Work through our channel partners,</li>
                    <li>Let us provide full service details,</li>
                    <li>Install our software in your data center.</li>
                </ol>
                We also supplement our ASP and installed customers with e-mail and technology services.
